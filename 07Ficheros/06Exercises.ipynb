    "From the `students.csv` file that contains the list of students in a high school with the following columns: `name`, `surname`, `age`, `course`, `average_grade`, create a Python program that filters students who have an average grade higher than 7 and saves them to a new CSV file called `outstanding_students.csv`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a Python program that checks if a file called `registrations.csv` exists with the following columns: `name`, `surnames`, `email` in the current directory. If it exists, it should read its content and generate the corresponding users in the system (you can simulate user creation by printing a message for each created user). The username should follow the format of the computer science domain users (a + year + name + surname initials, for example `a25mariarl` for María Rodríguez López registered in 2025). After processing the file, it should move it to a folder called `processed`, adding the current date and time to the file name (for example, `registrations_20240615_1030.csv`)."
