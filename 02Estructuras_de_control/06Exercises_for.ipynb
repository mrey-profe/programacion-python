    "# `for` Exercises\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "Create a Python program that displays the numbers from 100 down to 1.  \n",
    "Output: First, print each number on its own line, then print them all on the same line separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "Create a Python program that displays the numbers from 1 up to a number entered by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "Create a Python program that shows the numbers from a user-entered number down to 1, counting backwards by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "Create a Python program that shows the numbers from a larger number down to a smaller number, both entered by the user. Check that the first number is greater than the second; if it isn’t, display a message and exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 5\n",
    "Create a Python program that calculates the product of the first 10 odd numbers.  \n",
    "The result is **654729075**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 6\n",
    "In some English-speaking countries, people say “Mississippi” to count seconds, for example, when playing hide and seek. Create a program that counts up to 5 seconds, printing the number followed by “Mississippi” each time, and then prints “Go!”. The output should look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1 Mississippi\n",
    "2 Mississippi\n",
    "3 Mississippi\n",
    "4 Mississippi\n",
    "5 Mississippi\n",
    "Go!\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use the `time.sleep()` function to wait one second between each count. Look up how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 7: Vowel Eater\n",
    "Create a program that asks the user for a phrase and then displays that phrase in uppercase with all the vowels removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 8: Vowel Counter\n",
    "Create a program that asks the user for a phrase and tells them how many vowels it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 9\n",
    "Students at IES de Teis have an email address at the domain `iesteis.es`. This email consists of their classroom username followed by `@iesteis.es`. For example: `a23mariarm@iesteis.es`.  \n",
    "Write a Python program that asks the user for an email address and returns just the username part. For instance, for `a23mariarm@iesteis.es`, it should return `a23mariarm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 10: Does it have vowels?\n",
    "Create a program that asks the user for a phrase and tells them whether or not it contains any vowels."
