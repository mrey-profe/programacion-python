    "# Selective Structures Exercises\n",
    "## Recommended Path\n",
    "If you are just starting to learn programming, try to complete at least exercises 1 through 8. After that, attempt exercises 9 and 11.  \n",
    "If you have some programming experience, you can start with exercise 10.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "Write a Python program that asks for an integer from the keyboard and prints a message if the number is even (if it’s odd, it should not print anything).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "Modify the program to indicate whether the number is even or odd.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "Write a Python program that asks for two numbers from the keyboard and displays the smaller one (assume the numbers can’t be equal).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "Write a Python program that asks for a number from the keyboard and displays a message indicating whether it is negative or not. Zero is not negative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 5\n",
    "Write a Python program that asks for three numbers from the keyboard and displays the largest.  \n",
    "**ADVANCED VERSION**: Look up the `max()` function and try to solve this exercise with it (you won’t need conditional statements). Also look up the `min()` function and display both the largest and smallest numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 6\n",
    "Modify exercise 4 to indicate whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 7\n",
    "Write a Python program that asks for a number between 1 and 12 from the keyboard and displays the corresponding month name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 8\n",
    "Write a Python program that displays a grade based on a score entered from the keyboard:  \n",
    "- [0,5) Fail  \n",
    "- [5,6) Pass  \n",
    "- [6,7) Good  \n",
    "- [7,9) Very Good  \n",
    "-  Excellent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 9\n",
    "Your computer is a *huge fan* of the *Game of Thrones* series and won’t accept any other opinion; in fact, it’s quite the purist and only recognizes the original title.  \n",
    "Write a program that asks the user what their favorite series is and responds as follows based on the user’s answer:  \n",
    "- If the user answers “Game of Thrones,” the computer replies: `\"Of course, Game of Thrones is the best series ever!\"`  \n",
    "- If the user answers “Juego de Tronos,” the computer replies: `\"It’s not <input>, it’s Game of Thrones\"`  \n",
    "- Otherwise, the computer replies: `\"No, the best series is Game of Thrones!\"`  \n",
    "**ADVANCED VERSION**: Look up the `lower()` and `upper()` string methods so your program responds correctly no matter how the user capitalizes their answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 10\n",
    "Write a Python program that asks for a year from the keyboard and tells whether it is a leap year or not.  \n",
    "If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.  \n",
    "- Otherwise, if it is not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.  \n",
    "- Otherwise, if it is not divisible by 400, it is not a leap year.  \n",
    "- Otherwise, it is a leap year.  \n",
    "Use the `if-elif-else` structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can send your solution to codewars.com [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526c7363236867513f0005ca). \n",
    "\n",
    "**ADVANCED VERSION**: Can you do it using only one `if-else` and a single condition?  \n",

    "## Exercise 11  \n",
    "Once upon a time, there was a prosperous and happy kingdom. People paid taxes, of course—happiness has its limits. These taxes were paid once a year according to these rules:  \n",
    "- If a person earned no more than 85,528 thalers, the tax was 18% of their income minus 556.02 thalers.  \n",
    "- If earnings were higher, the tax was 14,839.02 thalers plus 32% of the excess over 85,528 thalers.  \n",
    "The program should accept a decimal value and display the tax rounded down to the nearest whole number. The government of this kingdom never refunds money, so if the calculated tax is negative, the program should display 0.  \n",
